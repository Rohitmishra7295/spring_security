🎯 What is Google OAuth 2.0 Playground?
Google OAuth Playground is an online tool by Google where you can test how OAuth 2.0 works — step-by-step — without writing any code.

✅ It helps developers to:

See how OAuth Authorization Code Flow works

Get Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens

Make API requests using those tokens manually

👉 Think of it like a practice area where you can safely try and understand OAuth.

🚀 What can you do with OAuth Playground?
Pick Google APIs you want to work with (like Gmail, Google Drive, Calendar, etc.)

Login and get an Authorization Code

Exchange the code for an Access Token

Use the token to call Google APIs (like list your Gmail labels or Google Drive files)

Refresh expired tokens

Learn how real OAuth2 apps talk to Google services

🛠️ How to Use Google OAuth Playground (Step-by-Step):
Visit:
👉 https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground

Choose the Google APIs you want to test:
(Example: Gmail API → https://mail.google.com/)

Click "Authorize APIs".

Google will ask you to log in and allow permissions.

After you allow, Google gives you an Authorization Code automatically.

Click "Exchange authorization code for tokens" to get:

Access Token (to access APIs)

Refresh Token (to get new Access Tokens later)

Now you can use the Access Token to make real API calls right inside the Playground.

✨ Bonus Tip:
You can also use your own Client ID and Client Secret instead of using Google's defaults.

This is very useful if you're testing your own app's OAuth setup.

📚 Why use OAuth Playground?
You can test without building a full app.

You can see how tokens are generated and used.

You can practice working with Google APIs.

You can debug OAuth errors easily.
